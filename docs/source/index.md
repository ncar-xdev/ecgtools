# Welcome to ecgtools's documentation!

## Motivation

The critical requirement for using [`intake-esm`](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm) is having a data catalog. `ecgtools` package enables you build data catalogs to be read in by [`intake-esm`](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm), which enables a user to easily search, discover, and access datasets they are interested in using.
